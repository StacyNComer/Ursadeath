 === Update 3 "Spawning of Doom!" ===

* Enemies now take a moment to "Spawn In" before recieving their AI and becoming tangible. Enemies are give a special
  material to show that they are spawning. The spawning sequence can be skipped by checking "Spawn Instantly".
	* As a result of this change, enemy pawns are not set to be auto-possessed. Turning back on auto-possession
	  will probably make something weird happen, so just use the "Spawn Instantly" variable!
	* The "Dummies" placed around the arena spawn instantly by default.
	* Note that enemy models are given their default material after going through the spawn sequence. "Spawn Instantly"
	  will stop the textures from being swapped. You can also find the mesh asset and change its default material.

 === Update 2 "AI of Doom!" ===

	> General

* Scripted the framework for enemy AI. An example melee enemy that chases the player (but doesn't attack) has been placed in the
  arena map.
	* All enemy AI Controllers are derived from the "UDEnemyController" class, which is made to have child classes made from it
	  using blueprints.
		* This class has an "EnemyBehavior" variable; Whatever Behavior Tree this variable is set to will be ran when the
		  game starts.
		* If the Behavior Tree's Blackboard has a value named "Player", it will be set to be the player's Actor.
		  BB_EnemyBase should already be set up like this, so I recommend you make any new Blackboards a child of this.
		* Enemies themselves have an "Attack" event that you can define behavior for in Blueprints. The enemy AI does
		  not currently call this event.
		* All of this info is on the project's Github under the "Enemy AI" wiki page.

 === Update 1 "Rockets of Doom!" ===

	> General

* The player can now press M2 to fire rockets. They look exactly like primary fire projectiles, but they explode when they hit something.

* Deleted unused blueprints (Pickup and FirstPersonProjectile).

* "UrsadeathCharacter" is now "UDPlayerCharacter" so that the naming scheme matches.

	> Bugfixes

* Fixed an issue where player attacks wouldn't collide with the arena.
