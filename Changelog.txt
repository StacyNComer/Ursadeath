 === Update 1 "Rockets of Doom!" ===

	> General

* The player can now press M2 to fire rockets. They look exactly like primary fire projectiles, but they explode when they hit something.

* Deleted unused blueprints (Pickup and FirstPersonProjectile).

* "UrsadeathCharacter" is now "UDPlayerCharacter" so that the naming scheme matches.

	> Bugfixes

* Fixed an issue where player attacks wouldn't collide with the arena.
