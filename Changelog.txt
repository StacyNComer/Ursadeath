 === Update 5 "HUD of Doom!" ===

* Added the framework for UI. 
	* The players HUD widget should be derived from the "UDPlayerHUDWidget" class. To define what happens when the
	   player's health/energy changes, use the respective "Update Health/Energy" event.
	* The player controller will automatically create and add whatever widget the "Player HUD Widget Class" is set to.
	  You can find the player controller in the player blueprint folder.
	* An example of the HUD Widget is in the UI folder. It should already be connected to the Player Controller.
	* Finally, if you get a weird crash that opens Visual Studio, most likely the Player Controller's 
	  "Player HUD Widget Class" value got set to "None".
	* This info can also be found in the project's wiki on Github's website!

# By the way, the player currently gains energy by shooting enemies with primary fire. You can change how much energy this
  gives the player in the projectile's blueprint. Rockets need 100 energy to be fired.

 === Update 4 "Arena of Doom!" ===

 * The game arena now takes the form of a blueprint.
	* You can make the arena spawn enemies by editing the Current Wave structure and setting the "Spawn On Begin
	  Play" value (under Debug) to true. The current arena in the game should already be set to spawn enemies.
	* The Spawn Wave asks for "Knight" and "Squire" enemies. These are merely tiers of strength for enemies.
	  Any enemy can be spawned as a Knight/Squire as there is no difference between them in script.

 * Added a "Test Knight" enemy type. It is large and has 1500 health (thrice that of the melee squire). It has the 
   same AI as the Melee Squire.

 === Update 3 "Spawning of Doom!" ===

* Enemies now take a moment to "Spawn In" before recieving their AI and becoming tangible. Enemies are give a special
  material to show that they are spawning. The spawning sequence can be skipped by checking "Spawn Instantly".
	* As a result of this change, enemy pawns are not set to be auto-possessed. Turning back on auto-possession
	  will probably make something weird happen, so just use the "Spawn Instantly" variable!
	* The "Dummies" placed around the arena spawn instantly by default.
	* Note that enemy models are given their default material after going through the spawn sequence. "Spawn Instantly"
	  will stop the textures from being swapped. You can also find the mesh asset and change its default material.

 === Update 2 "AI of Doom!" ===

	> General

* Scripted the framework for enemy AI. An example melee enemy that chases the player (but doesn't attack) has been placed in the
  arena map.
	* All enemy AI Controllers are derived from the "UDEnemyController" class, which is made to have child classes made from it
	  using blueprints.
		* This class has an "EnemyBehavior" variable; Whatever Behavior Tree this variable is set to will be ran when the
		  game starts.
		* If the Behavior Tree's Blackboard has a value named "Player", it will be set to be the player's Actor.
		  BB_EnemyBase should already be set up like this, so I recommend you make any new Blackboards a child of this.
		* Enemies themselves have an "Attack" event that you can define behavior for in Blueprints. The enemy AI does
		  not currently call this event.
		* All of this info is on the project's Github under the "Enemy AI" wiki page.

 === Update 1 "Rockets of Doom!" ===

	> General

* The player can now press M2 to fire rockets. They look exactly like primary fire projectiles, but they explode when they hit something.

* Deleted unused blueprints (Pickup and FirstPersonProjectile).

* "UrsadeathCharacter" is now "UDPlayerCharacter" so that the naming scheme matches.

	> Bugfixes

* Fixed an issue where player attacks wouldn't collide with the arena.
