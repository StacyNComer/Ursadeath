=== Update 18 "Seeds of Doom!" ===

	> General

* If the Game Instance's "Game Seed Name" is omitted, the game will now randomly generate a seed.
	
* The Game Seed is now diplayed at the bottom of the player's HUD.
	* Randomly generated seeds will be a sequence of numbers. If a word or phrase was input manually as the seed, 
	  than that will be shown instead.

	> Upgrades

* Upgrades can now be "disabled" from their data table, allowing them to be removed to help test other upgrades.

* Added the "Exhileration" upgrade, which Haste's the player for 8 seconds after they use their Shockwave.

* Added the "Shatter" upgrade, which causes a massive burst whenever the player collects a Health Pickup. The burst deals
  1500, stuns for 4 seconds, and has a radius of 1500 units.

* Added the "Blood Claw" upgrade, which doubles melee attack damage and causes the attack to stun. This upgrade has a
  5 second cooldown, which is displayed by an icon above the player's Energy Bar.

* Removed the "Tyranny" upgrade that gave invulnerability after using the Shockwave ability.

	> Enemies

* Gladiator's now have a visual effect while slowed.


=== Update 17 "Upgrades of Doom!" ===

	> General

* Added upgrades! The menu for choosing them is in the Round Screen (open with "T"). Don't forget to pick a new one every
  new round!
	* I'm serious about that last part. For now, the game lets you start the round without choosing an upgrade and
	  does not give so much as a warning when you do this. You can pick an upgrade mid-round if you forget, but once
	  the round ends, you'll lose the chance to pick one!
		# I'm probably just going to have an "Are you sure" message, since I like the idea of a player
		  challenging themselves to beat the game with fewer/no upgrades.
	* As for what upgrades have been added...
		* One makes melees heal you and grant a speed boost for 2.5 seconds on a kill.
		* Another causes Shockwaves to give the player invulnerability for 3 seconds.
			# This needs to be nerfed/removed. Enjoy it while you can!
		* And the last one (my favorite) causes bombs to fire a piercing beam when they explode. The beam
		  deals the bomb's direct hit damage (2000) and (like all aoe effects) go through walls!
			* An enemy directly hit by a bomb will not also be hit by the laser.

	> Player Character

* Health pickups now respawn when the round ends.

* Lowered the damage of melee attacks: 1000 => 700.
	# Not only did these do a crap ton of damage, but they also gave you a lot of energy! You could practically
	  play the game only using melee attacks and bombs! This alongside the increased health and danger enemies
	  have should curb Ursadeath's mighty claws while still making them want to get in close to gather energy.

* Increased the explosion radius of bombs: 500 => 750.
	# I mostly want it to be easier to hurt yourself with these.

* Reduced the energy gain of the primary fire: 3 => 2.
	# For perspective, the Energy/s of the player's primaryfire is decreased from 20 to ~13.
	# I want to increase the likelyhood that the player is forced to fish for melee attacks to keep their energy
	  up.

	> Enemies

* Adjusted the Gladiator enemy:
	* Increased their health: 2000 => 3000
	* They are faster: 500 => 750
	* But they are slowed by 60% after being damaged or stunned for 2 seconds.
	* Their attacks deal less damage: 35 => 20
	* The hitbox size for their melee attack has been shrunk to 75% of its original size.
	# Overall, they should be more threatening, but the player can mitigate their threat at the cost of
	  giving other enemies more time to kill you!

* Adjusted the Archer Legionarre enemy:
	* Increased their health: 750 => 1000
	* Increased their projectile speed: 1800 => 3000.
	* Made their projectiles 33% larger; They are now the same size as Ranged Squire shots.

* Adjusted the Vigilant enemy:
	* Increased their health: 1500 => 2200.
	* They no longer fire the moment they spawn (Thanks Travis!), instead waiting for 1 second.
	* The player's melee attacks deal 50% more damage (1050) instead of having their damage set to 3000.

* Adjusted the Ranged Squire enemy:
	* Increased their health: 400 => 600
	* Increase their projectile speed: 1800 => 3000.

* Adjusted the Melee Squire enemy:
	* Increased their health: 600 => 900.
	* They are faster: 500 => 600

	> Bugfixes

* Fixes a bug in which the player's upgrades would cease to have any effect some time after they were chosen.

* Fixed a bug where the Upgrade blueprints were unable to use many blueprint nodes (such as line traces).


=== Update 16 "Night City of Doom!" ===

	> General

* Enemies now have attack sounds.

* Adjusted the Gladiator:
	* They have more health 1500->2000.
	* Bombs deal 50% more damage to them and stun them for 2 seconds.

* Legionnaire Archers have reduced health 900->750.

* Vigilant now take 3000 bonus damage from melee attacks.

* The player's gun is now in the game!


=== Update 15 "Legionnaires of Doom!" ===

	> General

* Added Legionnaire Archers to the enemy pool. They fire projectiles in threes, spawn in pairs, and take 1000 damage
  (enough to kill them in 1 hit) when stunned.

	> Bugfixes

* The spawn pool of enemies as well the pool of enemy "rewards" now properly reset when the player respawns.

 
=== Update 14 "Foe Choices Doom!" ===

# We got accepted into Playtest Planet!

	> General

* Once per round, the player can now choose a Knight enemy type to appear in the current and future waves. Until an enemy
  type is chosen, they show up in the game's wave listings as an "Unchosen Foe".
	* An enemy type must be chosen before the player can start the round, unless all enemy types have been choosen.
	* The available enemies are taken from the Knight Spawn Data Table.
	* The appearance of the "Unchosen Foe" in the game's UI can be set from the UrsadeathGameInstance blueprint.

* Altered the enemy waves to introduce the second round's new enemy type better.


 === Update 13 "Night City Releas of Doom!" ===

	> General

* The player can now restart the game when they die.

* Adjusted the Lazer Knight:
	* Halved the distance they aim ahead of the player.
		# They have a comedic tendency to point their lasers way away from the player, often blocking some 
		  corner that the player hadn't planned on moving into anyway.
	* Halve the laser's warning period before it fires. (1s => 0.5s)
		# So that if that if the player decides to walk through the laser despite being warned of it, it comes
		  online just fast enough to hit them.

* Increased the damage Melee Knights deal (20 => 35).

* Increased the self damage Rockets deal to the player (10 => 20).

* Adjusted Health Pickups:
	* They take a slightly shorter time to respawn (35s => 30s).
	* They heal for slightly more (35 -> 40).

* A sound now plays whenever the player gains a bar of energy.

	> Bugfixes

* Ranged and Lazer enemies no longer freeze in place until something blocks their view of the player.

* The player now properly collides with enemies.


 === Update 13 "Finally Fixed UI of Doom!" ===

	> General

* Added a Game Over screen that appears when the player runs out of health.
	# Currently, the play mode must be exited and reopened to reset the game. There are a few things I need
	  to figure out before I can make the game properly reset itself!

* Added more sounds to the player including:
	* A "hurt" sound
	* A sound that plays when the player tries to use an ability without enough energy.

* Tweaked the size of the Round Screen UI button.

	> Bugfixes
	
* The Round Screen no longer needs to be clicked before the Round Start button can be pressed.

* The screen no longer needs to be clicked to aim after the player leaves the round screen.


 === Update 12 "QoL of Doom!" ===

	> General

* Added a crosshair

* Shockwaves now destroy projectiles.

* Enemies now have particles above their head while stunned.

* Enemies now make a sound when they take damage.

* Ranged Squires have been adjusted:
	* Their projectiles now have a bright gold emissive material.
	* They deal less damage (25 => 15) but have faster projectiles (800 => 1800).

* Reduced the attack cooldown of Laser Knights (5 => 3 seconds).

* Adjusted the player's primary fire.
	* The attack's energy gain has been reduced (5% => 3%)
	* The projectiles now move 50% faster (3000 => 4500).
		# This help make them feel like they have more "Oomf!" to them.

* The energy gain from melee attacks have been reduced (50% => 40%).

	> Bugfixes
		
* Fixed a bug where the InfiniteEnergy setting didn't actually work.

* Fixed a bug where the Laser Knight would continue to fire their laser even when stunned.

* Fixed a bug where the Ranged Squire's projectiles would block player movement but not actually damage them.

* The player start now ALWAYS spawns the player, preventing a confusing crash if something was placed over their spawn
   point.

	~ Known Bugs

* The game must be clicked before the Round Screen's "Begin Round" button may be pressed.

* When the Round Screen's "Begin Round" button is pressed and the Round Screen is exitted, the mouse must be clicked before
  the player can aim with it.

* When a ranged enemy spawns, they don't do anything until the player leaves their line of sight. Sometimes they will also
  freeze if the player is far away.


 === Update 11 "Descriptions of Doom!" ===

	> General

* The Round Screen now displays a description of an enemy type whenever its icon is moused over. (You might have to click
  the screen after opening the Round Screen to get this working)
	* Enemy descriptions can be editted in their "Spawn Data" data table. The description for squires can be editted in
	  the UrsadeathGameInstance class.

	~ Known Bugs

* The game must be clicked before the Round Screen's "Begin Round" button may be pressed.

* When the Round Screen's "Begin Round" button is pressed and the Round Screen is exitted, the mouse must be clicked before
  the player can aim with it.


 === Update 10 "Round Screen of Doom!" ===

	> General

* Added a "Round Screen" that can be open/closed with 'T'.

* Rounds are now started by pressing a "Begin Round" button in the Round Screen. Once a round is complete, the next round
  can be begun in the same manner, assuming a next round exists.

* Added health pickups which spawn at the arena's blue arrows when play is begun. They are used by meleeing them and
  respawn after 35 seconds.

* Added "Spawn Data" for the Lazer enemy. It currently uses a placeholder graphic for its icon.

* Made some adjustments to the Player HUD to make the spawn counters stay centered on different screen sizes.

	~ Known Bugs

* The game must be clicked before the Round Screen's "Begin Round" button may be pressed.

* When the Round Screen's "Begin Round" button is pressed and the Round Screen is exitted, the mouse must be clicked before
  the player can aim with it.


 === Update 9 "Spawn Counts of Doom!" ===

	> General

* Added counters that show how much of a given enemy type is left in a given wave.
	* Information on editting the UI for this can be found in the "Player HUD" section of the project's GitHub Wiki:
	   https://github.com/StacyNComer/Ursadeath/wiki

* You now spawn enemies in by pressing the "P" key. You can still set the Arena to spawn on Begin Play, 
  but the Spawn Indicators will not update to show what's in the wave.
	* You can change what is in the wave and its spawning behavior from the player character blueprint.


 === Update 8 "Testing of Doom!" ===

	> General

* The Test Knight enemy now has its own models and animations
	# It's just an upscaled version of the Melee Squire with x3 health.

* Melee attacks have been tweaked some:
	* They have slightly longer range: 250 -> 300.
	* They give slightly less energy: 66% -> 50%.

* Ranged Squires have a bit less health: 500 -> 400.

	> Bugfixes

* Fixed a bug where enemies would not stop moving when stunned.

* The enemies with the new models now properly collide with the player and their attacks.

* Fixed a bug where the sword of melee squires could be hit by player attacks.

* Fixed a bug where Rocket explosions dealt damage as if it were a direct hit.

* Fixed a bug where Ranged Squire projectiles would go through everything.


 === Update 7 "Particles of Doom!" ===

	> General

* Added VFX for the melee attack, Shockwave, and Rocket Explosion.

* The player character can now be set to have infinite energy.
	* As a reminder, you can also set individual ability components to require 0 energy. Only the Rocket
	  and Shockwave abilities have an energy setting.

* Explosive projectiles now have an "ExplosionDebug" property that prints each actor the explosion detected.
	* Note that explosions should detect all Actors with the Pawn and Player object types, but will
	  only damage actors that are derived from the Enemy or PlayerCharacter classes.

 === Update 6 "Weapons of Doom!" ===

	> General

* Added melee attacks. Melee attacks give the player 66% energy on hit.
	* This does not have a vfx, so for now the collision test is visible.

* Added Shockwaves. Shockwaves deal no damage, but stun all enemies in a wide line for 4 seconds. 
  Shockwave cost 100% energy.
	* This does not have a vfx, so for now the collision test is visible.
	# This probably needs to be nerfed somehow.

* Refactored all of the player's abilities as PlayerAbilityComponents. This groups all the info about each particular
  attack's interaction with the player (energy cost, cooldown, input binding) under their own blueprint component.
	* Currently, PlayerAbilities are not automatically bound to their inputs. If you try and add your onw ability,
	  you'll need to bind the input yourself!

	> Bugfixes

* Fixed a bug where the game would crash if a projectile hit an enemy within a frame of being spawned.


 === Update 5 "HUD of Doom!" ===

* Added the framework for UI. 
	* The players HUD widget should be derived from the "UDPlayerHUDWidget" class. To define what happens when the
	   player's health/energy changes, use the respective "Update Health/Energy" event.
	* The player controller will automatically create and add whatever widget the "Player HUD Widget Class" is set to.
	  You can find the player controller in the player blueprint folder.
	* An example of the HUD Widget is in the UI folder. It should already be connected to the Player Controller.
	* Finally, if you get a weird crash that opens Visual Studio, most likely the Player Controller's 
	  "Player HUD Widget Class" value got set to "None".
	* This info can also be found in the project's wiki on Github's website!

# By the way, the player currently gains energy by shooting enemies with primary fire. You can change how much energy this
  gives the player in the projectile's blueprint. Rockets need 100 energy to be fired.


 === Update 4 "Arena of Doom!" ===

 * The game arena now takes the form of a blueprint.
	* You can make the arena spawn enemies by editing the Current Wave structure and setting the "Spawn On Begin
	  Play" value (under Debug) to true. The current arena in the game should already be set to spawn enemies.
	* The Spawn Wave asks for "Knight" and "Squire" enemies. These are merely tiers of strength for enemies.
	  Any enemy can be spawned as a Knight/Squire as there is no difference between them in script.

 * Added a "Test Knight" enemy type. It is large and has 1500 health (thrice that of the melee squire). It has the 
   same AI as the Melee Squire.


 === Update 3 "Spawning of Doom!" ===

* Enemies now take a moment to "Spawn In" before recieving their AI and becoming tangible. Enemies are give a special
  material to show that they are spawning. The spawning sequence can be skipped by checking "Spawn Instantly".
	* As a result of this change, enemy pawns are not set to be auto-possessed. Turning back on auto-possession
	  will probably make something weird happen, so just use the "Spawn Instantly" variable!
	* The "Dummies" placed around the arena spawn instantly by default.
	* Note that enemy models are given their default material after going through the spawn sequence. "Spawn Instantly"
	  will stop the textures from being swapped. You can also find the mesh asset and change its default material.


 === Update 2 "AI of Doom!" ===

	> General

* Scripted the framework for enemy AI. An example melee enemy that chases the player (but doesn't attack) has been placed in the
  arena map.
	* All enemy AI Controllers are derived from the "UDEnemyController" class, which is made to have child classes made from it
	  using blueprints.
		* This class has an "EnemyBehavior" variable; Whatever Behavior Tree this variable is set to will be ran when the
		  game starts.
		* If the Behavior Tree's Blackboard has a value named "Player", it will be set to be the player's Actor.
		  BB_EnemyBase should already be set up like this, so I recommend you make any new Blackboards a child of this.
		* Enemies themselves have an "Attack" event that you can define behavior for in Blueprints. The enemy AI does
		  not currently call this event.
		* All of this info is on the project's Github under the "Enemy AI" wiki page.


 === Update 1 "Rockets of Doom!" ===

	> General

* The player can now press M2 to fire rockets. They look exactly like primary fire projectiles, but they explode when they hit something.

* Deleted unused blueprints (Pickup and FirstPersonProjectile).

* "UrsadeathCharacter" is now "UDPlayerCharacter" so that the naming scheme matches.

	> Bugfixes

* Fixed an issue where player attacks wouldn't collide with the arena.
