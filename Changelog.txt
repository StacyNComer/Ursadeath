=== Update 39.01 Game Start Overhaul! ===

	> Bugfixes

* The game no longer prevents the player from starting the round if they reset the game without choosing 
  an enemy.

	~ Known Bugs

* Buttons do not appear "pressed" when used via controller input.

* Sometimes Vigilant show their laser before spawning!

* Clicking an upgrade/knight after it is already selected will make it appear deselected but still let you
  confirm it as if it were still selected.

* Occaisionally, the numbers for the Blood Claw upgrade's cooldown do not disappear when the cooldown reaches
  0. 


=== Update 39 Game Start Overhaul! ===
[None of these affect the actual game, but should make testing it A LOT easier]

* You can now have the game start on a Wave/Round other than the first. The starting round and starting 
  wave in that round can be set via the UrsadeathGameInstance Blueprint.
	# IMPORTANT NOTE: The game's WAVES/ROUNDS start from 0. (e.g. Round 1 in the UrsadeathGameInstance is
	  actually Round 2!).

	> Bugfixes

* Enemies should now be able to move when manually dragged into the level instead of spawned.
	# The game was trying to treat them as a wall for the purpose of navigation, so they were essentially
	  "stuck" inside themselves.

	~ Known Bugs

* Buttons do not appear "pressed" when used via controller input.

* Sometimes Vigilant show their laser before spawning!

* Clicking an upgrade/knight after it is already selected will make it appear deselected but still let you

* Occaisionally, the numbers for the Blood Claw upgrade's cooldown do not disappear when the cooldown reaches
  0.


=== Update 38.02 ===
[This is the Alpha v3 update!]

(You don't need new compiled code if you already have the code that came with Update 38)

* Adjusted the Siphon Soul upgrade:
	* It now only heals when a non-Squire is killed.
	* The healing amount has been reduced to 8 hitpoints.
	# The Haste effect alone makes this upgrade good. Healing from squires basically means you'll only
	   die if you try to stage dive a swarm of enemies.

* Increased the Archer Legionairre projectile damage: 8 => 10.

* Melee attacks can now be performed by pressing the right thumbstick on controller.

* The Valiant description now clarifies that damage from rocket upgrades also stuns them and correctly
  gives the rocket damage stun as 2.5 seconds instead of 2 seconds.

* The Archer Legionarre description now correctly states the stuns last 50% longer instead of twice as long.

* Swapped around some of the enemy death sound to (hopefully) be more fitting.

* Made the enemy hit sound slightly quieter.

	> Bugfixes

* Fixed a bug that kept enemies from pathing through the center of the arena.

* The "Low Health" HUD effect now properly scales to different screen sizes.

* The Round Screen's buttons now properly work with controller.

* Removed the "Press ESC to quit" text from the HUD.

* Corrected a typo in the Piercing Blast upgrade description.

	~ Known Bugs

* Valiant can sometimes hit the player twice with their melee attacks.

* Buttons do not appear "pressed" when used via controller input.

* Sometimes Vigilant show their laser before spawning!

* Clicking an upgrade/knight after it is already selected will make it appear deselected but still let you
  confirm it as if it were still selected.

* Occaisionally, the numbers for the Blood Claw upgrade's cooldown do not disappear when the cooldown reaches
  0.


=== Update 38.01 ===

(You don't need new compiled code if you already have the code that came with Update 38)

* Increased the size of the Health Pickup base plate.

* Scaled the Health Pickup respawn VFX to fit with the base plate.

* Reverted the enemy hit sound to the old "hitmarker" sound.

	~ Known Bugs

* Buttons do not appear "pressed" when used via controller input.

* Sometimes Vigilant show their laser before spawning!

* Clicking an upgrade/knight after it is already selected will make it appear deselected but still let you
  confirm it as if it were still selected.

* Occaisionally, the numbers for the Blood Claw upgrade's cooldown do not disappear when the cooldown reaches
  0.


=== Update 38 Reset of Doom ===

* The energy bar now has a number showing the current energy bars full.

* The the game can now be restarted from the first Round/Wave via the Main Menu. No longer will you have to
  turn off and back on the game!

* Added a credits screen to the pause menu.

* The Round Screen can now be closed via the ESCAPE key.

* The ESCAPE key now backs out of whatever submenu is open in the Pause Menu. If the Pause Menu is at its root
  menu, the game instead resumes.
	* Backing out of any of the confirmation screens (such as the Quit confirmation screen) will close the
	  screen instead of "confirming" the action. This should make it hard for a player to accidently change
	  their settings or quit the game.

* The Settings menu should no longer be refered to as the "Options" menu anywhere in game or within blueprints.

* Increased Rocket direct hit damage ever so slightly: 2500 -> 2600
	# So that they oneshot Vigilants after their health buff.

	> Bugfixes

* The How-to-play screen's background now scales correctly with different sized displays.

* The Round Screen no longer has the outdated How-To-Play screen.

* The "No Upgrade" confirmation now closes if the Round Screen is exited.

* Deleted the stray blue ring that was under the arena.

	~ Known Bugs

* Buttons do not appear "pressed" when used via controller input.

* Sometimes Vigilant show their laser before spawning!

* Clicking an upgrade/knight after it is already selected will make it appear deselected but still let you
  confirm it as if it were still selected.

* Occaisionally, the numbers for the Blood Claw upgrade's cooldown do not disappear when the cooldown reaches
  0.
 

=== Update 37 Nerfs of Doom II === 
TODO: Update the upgrade Descs.

* Melee attacks now give less energy: 25% => 20%.

* Primary Fire now gives less energy: 2% => 1%.

* Adjusted Rockets:
	* Reduced the self damage: 30 => 25.
	* Quadrupeled the projectile speed: 3000 => 12000.
	* Increased the projectile diameter: 20 => 50.
	# I wanted to make the rocket able to compete more with the Shockwave. Now there is less risk
	  of damaging onself or missing the attack entirely. I also buffed its upgrades (see below). I the
	  future, I want to add more rocket upgrades that interact with the player's melee or primary fire.
	  I suspect another major problem with rockets is that their upgrades both aren't particularly strong
	  and don't have synergy with anything.

* Adjusted the Blood Claw upgrade:
	* Increased the cooldown: 9s => 16s.
	* Increased the Stun time: 2s => 3s.
	* Blood Claw now only triggers if hitting a Knight tier enemy.
	# This was basically a free rocket every 9 seconds!
	
* Reduced the stun time for Flick of the Wrist: 8s => 5s.

* Adjusted the Thunderstorm upgrade:
	* Increased the radius: 750 => 1000.
	* Upon obtaining the upgrade, a ring showing the lightning radius appears around the player.
		* sparks also spawn around them!

* Doubled the beam radius of the "Piercing Blast" upgrade: 100 => 200.

* The Shockwave no longer effects an area behind the player.
	# I want to make the Shockwave just slightly less safe.

* The Shockwave now correctly stuns for 5s instead of 6s.
	# The last update was supposed to have this change, but I seem to have left it out by accident. :P

* Bumped up the health of Vigilants: 2200 => 2600.
	# Now it takes 2 melees and 5 primary shots (~.75s of firing) instead of 2 melees and just 1. Doing a
	  bit of experimenting. I'm planning to do a major rebalance of the content of enemy waves, so I
	  don't think enemies actually need much of a buff. This does, however, make Shockwave + Melee a bit
	  less reliable against these enemies.

* The Valiant now gets stunned slightly longer when hit by a rocket: 2s => 2.5s.
	# Even I would get hit half the time when trying to take advantage of this. It almost felt like a
	  trap.

	> Bugfixes

* Status icons, such as for Haste or the Blood Claw cooldown, no longer count down while the game is paused,
  which would cause them to become desynced from the actual cooldown.

* It should no longer be possible for an enemy to "die" a second time, causing the enemy counter to be become
  negative and softlocking the game.
	# I say "should" because this bug was rare enough that there is a very real chance I just didn't run
	  into it after "fixing" it.

	~ Known Bugs

* Buttons do not appear "pressed" when used via controller input.

* Sometimes Vigilant show their laser before spawning!

* If you close a menu with a confirmation screen up, the confirmation screen will still be up when the menu
  is reopened.


=== Update 36 Nerfs of Doom I ===

* Reduced the player's max energy: 300 => 400.
	* For perspective, using a Rocket/Shockwave costs 100 energy.
	# A single rocket/shockwave can be quite powerful, so rather than nerf them, I'm making it
	  harder to horde them and burst down difficult waves.

* Shockwaves have been nerfed:
	* Their width is reduced: 1400 => 700.
	* The stun time has been reduced: 6s => 5s.

* Decreased the Archer Legionarre's Stun Multiplier: x2 => x1.5

* Increased the Archer Legionarre's Projectile Speed: 3000 => 4500.
	# I want the player to have to respect their space a bit more.

* Increased the Archer Legionarre's movement speed: 400 => 600.

* Changed the enemy hitsound to something hopefully less grating.

	~ Known Bugs

* The energy bars divisions are slightly misaligned; the player needs slightly more than a full bar before they
   gain a use of their rocket/shockwave.

* Buttons do not appear "pressed" when used via controller input.

* Sometimes Vigilant show their laser before spawning!

* Very rarely, it is possible to "kill" an extra enemy and thus make the enemy counter negative, softlocking the
  game!

* If you close a menu with a confirmation screen up, the confirmation screen will still be up when the menu
  is reopened.


=== Update 35 Settings of Doom ===

* Added a settings menu to the game. Currently this allows the aim sensitivity to be adjusted for controller
  and keyboard and for the Y-Axis aiming to be inverted.

* The How-to-Play screen can now be viewed from the pause menu.

* The pause menu now has the game title!

	> Bugfixes

* Gladiators and melee squires should no longer be able to hit the play more than once with a single attack.

* The "low health" animation now properly loops instead of only playing once.

* The "low health" animation now properly disappears when the player is healed above 50% health.

	~ Known Bugs

* Buttons do not appear "pressed" when used via controller input.

* Sometimes Vigilant show their laser before spawning!

* Very rarely, it is possible to "kill" an extra enemy and thus make the enemy counter negative, softlocking the
  game!

* If you close a menu with a confirmation screen up, the confirmation screen will still be up when the menu
  is reopened.


=== Update 34 Pause Menu of Doom ===

* There is now a pause menu! Instead of closing the game "Escape" now opens a pause menu.
	* "Start" on controller should also work.
	* Tilde (the `~ key) now ends playmode, assuming editor preferences carry over. If this is not the case,
	  the keyboard shortcut can be changed via Edit/Editor Preferences/Keyboard Shortcuts [under "General"
          on the left hand menu]/Play World (PIE/SIE) via the "Stop" binding.

	~ Known Bugs

* Buttons do not appear "pressed" when used via controller input.

* Sometimes Gladiators and Melee Squires can hit the player more than once with a single melee attack!

* Sometimes Vigilant show their laser before spawning!

* Very rarely, it is possible to "kill" an extra enemy and thus make the enemy counter negative, softlocking the
  game!

* If you close a menu with a confirmation screen up, the confirmation screen will still be up when the menu
  os reopened.


=== Update 33 Better Health Pickups of Doom ===

* Health Pickups now have a cooldown of 1 second as long as the round has not been started.
	# This is in case the player wants to mess around with them in between rounds.

* Health pickups no longer respawn on cooldown while the round is active. Instead, a single used health pickup
  respawns at the end of each wave.
	#  This is to discourage stalling for the pickup to respawn while also making them feel a tad more
	   consistent in how they behave between waves.

* Health pickups now respawn when a new round starts in addition to whenever a round ends.
	# Otherwise, the player could accidently make it where they are missing a health pickup due to the above
	  two changes.

* Health Pickups now have a particle effect whenever they are collected and whenever they respawn.

* The How-To-Play screen now tells the player how health pickups work.

* The How-To-Play tip about explosions going through walls now includes beams in its explanation.

* The "Flick of the Wrist" upgrade (MeleeBeam in blueprints) has improved VFX: It is easier to see the intial
  beam being fired and enemies hit by the attack now emit a burst of particles. 

* Went through and adjusted all of the enemy and upgrade descriptions. They should in general be slighty
  shorter and slightly more informative. Some specific changes include:
	* The Archer Legionnare enemy description no longer incorrectly mentions them taking damage when
	  stunned.
	* The Gladiator enemy now says how long it is stunned for when damaged by Rockets.
	* The Piercing Blast upgrade no longer refers to rockets as "Bombs".
	* The Siphon Soul upgrade now says how much it heals for.

		> Bugfixes

* The Shockwave's particle FX now reflects the ability's actual width and length.
	# Good job on the effect Laura!
	# Oh, and incase anyone is messing around with the blueprint, the particle FX width now
	   automatically changes with the Shockwave's own "Width" variable so you can see the
	   attack and effect's size even before runtime!

	~ Known Bugs

* Buttons do not appear "pressed" when used via controller input.

* Sometimes Gladiators and Melee Squires can hit the player more than once with a single melee attack!


=== Update 32 More UI of Doom ===

* The How-to-play menu now has controls for joystick.

* There is now a visual effect for when a Ranged Squire or Archer Legionnare are about to fire.

	> Bugfixes

* The "don't show this message again" checkbox for the "no upgrade" confirmation screen can now be pressed
  via controller.

	~ Known Bugs

* Buttons do not appear "pressed" when used via controller input.


=== Update 31 Aiming of Doom ===

* Revamped controller aiming:
	* Lowered the overall aim sensitivity (no idea why I had it so high in the first place!)
	* The y axis is now less sensitive than the x axis.
	* Added smoothing to the aiming. It should be at least a little easier to track enemies as you or
	  they move.

* The UI cursor speed when controlled by a controller now properly scales with the screen size: It
   should no longer be too slow and large screens and too fast on small screens.

	~ Known Bugs

* Buttons do not appear "pressed" when used via controller input.

* This isn't really a bug, but the How-to-play screen should probably show the controls for
  controller.


=== Update 30 Feel of Doom ===

* Reduced the speed multiplier from the Haste effect: 50% => 40%.
	# This is less to nerf Haste and more to make it feel better. I found it hard to position the
	  character or even aim during Haste with how absurdly fast it was!

* Increased the player acceleration: 6144 => 20000.

* Increased the Shockwave Width: 250 => 700.
	# I'm hoping this is the change that will tip the Shockwave into being an equal to Rockets. It
	  should be much easier to lock down entire swathes of enemies now!

* The Shockwave to extends behind the player by a length equal to its width (so currently 700 units).

	> Bugfixes

* The pentagram symbol for the Blood Claw explosion is no longer invisible most of the time.	

	~ Known Bugs

* Buttons do not appear "pressed" when used via controller input.

* This isn't really a bug, but the How-to-play screen should probably show the controls for
  controller.


=== Update 29.01 Menu Controls of Doom ===

	> Bugfixes

* Turned off the player's infinite energy! Rockets/Shockwaves should now use energy again!
	# If ever you notice this in the future, infinite energy can be turned on/off in the
	  Player Character Blueprint! You don't even need this update technically!
	
	~ Known Bugs

* Buttons do not appear "pressed" when used via controller input.
	# I might not even fix this one. I have some sledgehammering to do for the final implementation of
	  controller UI.


=== Update 29 Menu Controls of Doom ===

* A controller can now be used to move the mouse cursor while in the Round Menu and Game Over screen. The
  "Bottom Face Button" ("A" on an Xbox controller) can be used to "click" buttons.

* The UI can no longer be operated with pure keyboard.
	# Unreal's default system for this (as far as I've looked into it) cannot have edits made to it	

	> Bugfixes

* The confirmation message for starting the round without an upgrade now properly displays over the round
  menu instead of being under it.

	~ Known Bugs

* Buttons do not appear "pressed" when used via controller input.


=== Update 28 Joystick of Doom ===

* Added partial controller support: The player character can be full controlled with a controller,
  but the round menu cannot be navigated yet.
	* Right trigger -> Primary
	* Right bumper -> Melee
	* Left trigger -> Rockets
	* Left bumber -> Shockwave
	* Open Round Screen/Pause -> Option
	* You can edit the aim sensitivity via /PlayerCharacter/Input/IMC_Default. Under the
	   IA_Look mapping, open the GamePad option and then the "Modifiers" option. Finally
	   find the "Scalar" setting and adjust the values to your liking.
		* There is no auto aim or aim acceleration, so it'll probably feel awkward no
		  matter what you set it to...

* The Shockwave now stuns longer 4s => 5s.
	# I'm going to be testing some slight buffs to the Shockwave. Try it and let me know what
	  you think. I'm also open to suggestions!

	> Bugfixes

* Fixed a bug where Vigilant lasers would appear short when aimed at the arena's outer walls.

	~ Known Bugs

* Ranged Squires, Archer Legionnaires, and Vigilants do not have a proper death animation if killed
  while stunned.

* This isn't really a bug, but the How-to-play screen should probably show the controls for
  controller.


=== Update 27 Rainbow of Doom ===

* Gave the "Flick of the Wrist" (Melee Beam) upgrade a minor rework: It now refracts to the two
  nearest targets on impact. If it misses, it instead refracts to the three nearest targets.
	* Regardless of the number of targets hit, only the first target hit grants energy.

	~ Known Bugs

* Ranged Squires and Archer Legionairres do not ragdoll out of their death animations.


=== Update 26 How-To-Play of Doom ===

* Added a How-To-Play screen.


=== Update 25.02 ===

* Enemy's now support having a death sound.

	> Bugfixes

* The new upgrade icons now properly show in game.

	~ Known Bugs

* Gladiators and Melee Squires do not stop attacking when stunned.


=== Update 25.01 ===
	
	> Bugfixes

* Fixed a bug where Gladiators and Melee Squires had no collision against the player
  or their attacks.

* Fixed a bug where attacks no longer slowed Gladiators.

* Fixed a bug where enemy Anim Blueprints wouldn't be update when an enemy was stunned.
	# There aren't any stun animations, of course, but if there were they wouldn't
	  have worked.

	~ Known Bugs

* Gladiators and Melee Squires do not stop attacking when stunned.


=== Update 25 "Corpses of Doom!" ===

* All enemies now have death animations and leave behind corpses.
	* Corpses are cleared when the next wave of enemies begins spawning.
	# I'm thinking of having a setting that controls how often corpses get deleted.


=== Update 24 "Laser Fist of Doom!" ===

* Added the "Flick of a Wrist" upgrade (named "MeleeBeamUpgrade" in the code). This upgrade
  makes it so that after the player uses a Shockwave, their next melee attack fires as a
  laser, deals 30% more damage (910), and stuns for 8 seconds. The laser pierces walls but 
  not enemies.
	* To help with the "feel" of this upgrade, firing a Shockwave also resets the
	   0.5s cooldown that the melee attack normally has.
	* This upgrade stacks with Blood Claw in a few of interesting ways: 
		* It allows Blood Claw's explosion to be spawned at a distant enemy.
		* It stacks with Blood Claw's damage increase, resulting in x2.6 (1820)
		  damage.
		* It stacks with Blood Claw's stun, resulting in a total stun time of
		   9 seconds.

* Tweaked the "Blood Claw" upgrade:
	* The explosion now only spawns when an enemy is hit.
	* The explosion is now centered on the enemy hit instead of the player.

* Removed the "Tyranny" upgrade.

* Increased the self damage of the player's rockets: 20 => 30.

	> Bugfixes

* The attack spawned by the "Thunderstorm" upgrade no longer causes errors when the player
  has upgrades that test for a certain type of attack.


=== Update 23 "Claw of Doom!" ===

	> General

* The Blood Claw upgrade now has a new and fancy particle effect and icon.

* Enemies other than the Gladiator can now be slowed via the Apply Slow function.

* Reworked the "Tyranny" upgrade to instead slow enemies for 16 seconds.
	* The slow effect (which lasts 4 seconds) starts at the same time as the stun effect, 
	   so enemies will be slowed for 12 seconds after the stun ends and they can move.
 

=== Update 22 "Storm of Doom!" ===

	> General

* Any unchosen upgrades are now shuffled to the end of the upgrade pool at the end of the round.
	* Basically, you won't see upgrades you have had the option of choosing until every
	   upgrade has been an option.
	# While this will make it harder a achieve specific builds unless the player is lucky,
	  I hope this will encourage the player to learn a variety of builds and strategies even
	  after a winning combo is found. This change will be most noticable when there are more
	  upgrades and rounds.

* Added the ThunderBomb upgrade (known in game as "Thunderstorm"). Causes lightning to strike all
  enemies within 700 units of the player whenever they fire a rocket, dealing the rocket's
  explosion damage to them (1500).
	* The thunder "blast" counts as a separate attack from the rocket and its explosion,
	   meaning that a brave player can attempt to "stack" the two by firing at an enemy
	   close to them, at the cost of damaging themselves.

* The explosion from the Blood Claw upgrade no longer grants energy.
	# This ability did everything you could ever want it to while costing no energy. Now
	   it has at least a small tradeoff

* Legionnaire Archers being stunned no longer causes them to take damage.
	# This will make it harder to stun large swathes of enemies, kill half of them, and
	  escape with enough energy to do it again.

	> Bugfixes

* Health pickups no longer block the Vigilant's laser attack.

* The lava walls now correctly block the Vigilant's laser attack.

* The Viligant's laser attack no longer appears extra short if the player blocks it before moving
  away and now correctly lengthens until a wall is hit when the player is no longer in front of
  the laser.


=== Update 21 "Arena of Doom!" ===

	> General

* Increased the size of health pickups by 25%. They also now float 5 units higher off the ground.

* Health Pickups now have a progress icon below them while respawning.

	> Bugfixes

* Moved old arena BSP to a separate level and deleted it from the main level.

* Deleted the "Dummy" enemies which were below the arena.

* The spinning heart within health pickups no longer have collision.


=== Update 20 "Veinte of Doom!" ===

	> General

* The Round Menu's "Start Button" now changes its text when disabled based on why the round cannot
   be started. For instance, it says "Round In Progress" if the current round has yet to be
   completed.

* There is now a confirmation message when the player attempts to start a round without an
  upgrade choosen. If a particularly bold player wishes to simply not have upgrades, there
  is a checkbox to stop showing the warning. 


=== Update 19 "Big Waves of Doom!" ===

	> General

* The game now generates a new random seed whenever the game is reset after player death. If a custom
   seed was manually input into the GameInstance, the seed will instead remain the same.

	> Player Character

* Increased the player's base movement speed: 900 => 1000.
	* Because the Haste effect is a mulitplier (* 150%) on the player's base speed, the Hasted speed 
          is also faster.
	   
* Reduced the energy gained from melee attacks: 40 => 25.
	# I'm hoping to make the Shockwave/Melee combo less self sustaining: It should be harder to simply
	   stunlock every enemy using this combo without something getting close and smacking you.
	# For perspective, Rockets/Shockwaves cost 100 energy to use.

* Both the direct hit and explosion damage of Rockets is increased by 500.
	* Direct hit damage: 2000 => 2500
	* Explosion damage: 1000 => 1500
	# Direct hits now one-shot Viligants. Explosions now one-shot Legionnaire Archers.

* Doubled the player's acceleration. (2048 => 4096)
	# This is to make the player's movement feel smoother while they have the Haste effect.

	> Upgrades

* Reworked the SuperPunch "Blood Claw" upgrade:
	* The Blood Claw now creates a 1000 radius explosion around the player that deals the same damage of the
	   melee attack.
	* Increased the Blood Claw's cooldown: 5s => 9s.

* Reduced the haste time of the ShockwaveHaste "Exhileration": 8s => 5s.
	# The Haste effect is at least a little stronger than I anticipated.

* Nerfed the MeleeHeal "Siphon Soul" upgrade:
	* Reduced the healing values:
		* Squire heal: 8% => 5%
		* Champion heal: 16% => 10%

* Adjusted the PickupBomb "Shatter" upgrade:
	* It's radius is larger: 1000 => 2000.
	* It deals more damage: 1500 => 2000.
	* It stuns enemies longer: 4s => 5s.
		# This also means their description, which was previously wrong, is now correct about the
		   stun time.

* Increased the beam radius of the BombBeam (Piercing Blast) upgrade: 50 => 100.

	> Enemies

* Rebalanced the game to spawn more enemies at once on the second and third round.

* Adjusted the Vigilant enemy:
	* Reduced the damage of the Vigilant: 15 => 11.
		* This lowers the Vigilant's DPS to the player from 60%/s to 44%/s.

* Adjusted Legionnaire Archers
	* Increased the Health of Legionnaire Archers 1000 => 1400.
	* Reduced their damage: 10 => 8.
		* The damage of all 3 projectiles hitting is now: 30 => 24.
	* Decreased the range at which they no longer walk closer to the player while their attack is on
	  cooldown: 1000 => 500. 
		# Thanks Travis!
	* Being stunned no longer instantly kills them and instead deals 1100 damage to them.
	* They are now stunned for twice as long.

* Reduced the damage of Ranged Squires: 15 => 10.
	# Since there are a lot of enemies, I wanted to reduce the damage the player takes from stray
	  projectiles.

* Reduced the damage of Melee Squires: 20 => 15.
	# 20 is way too much for how many there can be now, even if the player shouldn't really be taking
	  hits from them.

	> Bugfixes

* The game no longer crashes if one of the player's projectiles hit an enemy the moment that it spawns.

* Upgrades no longer occur more than once if the game is reset while they are in the pool.

	# Technical

* All enemies can now have the damage that they take printed to the screen as if they were test dummies. This
  can be enabled via the "PrintDamageTaken" property under the Actor's "Debug" category.


=== Update 18 "Seeds of Doom!" ===

	> General

* If the Game Instance's "Game Seed Name" is omitted, the game will now randomly generate a seed.
	
* The Game Seed is now diplayed at the bottom of the player's HUD.
	* Randomly generated seeds will be a sequence of numbers. If a word or phrase was input manually as the seed, 
	  then that will be shown instead.

	> Upgrades

* Upgrades can now be "disabled" from their data table, allowing them to be removed to help test other upgrades.

* Added the "Exhileration" upgrade, which Haste's the player for 8 seconds after they use their Shockwave.

* Added the "Shatter" upgrade, which causes a massive burst whenever the player collects a Health Pickup. The burst deals
  1500, stuns for 4 seconds, and has a radius of 1500 units.

* Added the "Blood Claw" upgrade, which doubles melee attack damage and causes the attack to stun. This upgrade has a
  5 second cooldown, which is displayed by an icon above the player's Energy Bar.

* Removed the "Tyranny" upgrade that gave invulnerability after using the Shockwave ability.

	> Enemies

* Gladiator's now have a visual effect while slowed.


=== Update 17 "Upgrades of Doom!" ===

	> General

* Added upgrades! The menu for choosing them is in the Round Screen (open with "T"). Don't forget to pick a new one every
  new round!
	* I'm serious about that last part. For now, the game lets you start the round without choosing an upgrade and
	  does not give so much as a warning when you do this. You can pick an upgrade mid-round if you forget, but once
	  the round ends, you'll lose the chance to pick one!
		# I'm probably just going to have an "Are you sure" message, since I like the idea of a player
		  challenging themselves to beat the game with fewer/no upgrades.
	* As for what upgrades have been added...
		* One makes melees heal you and grant a speed boost for 2.5 seconds on a kill.
		* Another causes Shockwaves to give the player invulnerability for 3 seconds.
			# This needs to be nerfed/removed. Enjoy it while you can!
		* And the last one (my favorite) causes bombs to fire a piercing beam when they explode. The beam
		  deals the bomb's direct hit damage (2000) and (like all aoe effects) go through walls!
			* An enemy directly hit by a bomb will not also be hit by the laser.

	> Player Character

* Health pickups now respawn when the round ends.

* Lowered the damage of melee attacks: 1000 => 700.
	# Not only did these do a crap ton of damage, but they also gave you a lot of energy! You could practically
	  play the game only using melee attacks and bombs! This alongside the increased health and danger enemies
	  have should curb Ursadeath's mighty claws while still making them want to get in close to gather energy.

* Increased the explosion radius of bombs: 500 => 750.
	# I mostly want it to be easier to hurt yourself with these.

* Reduced the energy gain of the primary fire: 3 => 2.
	# For perspective, the Energy/s of the player's primaryfire is decreased from 20 to ~13.
	# I want to increase the likelyhood that the player is forced to fish for melee attacks to keep their energy
	  up.

	> Enemies

* Adjusted the Gladiator enemy:
	* Increased their health: 2000 => 3000
	* They are faster: 500 => 750
	* But they are slowed by 60% after being damaged or stunned for 2 seconds.
	* Their attacks deal less damage: 35 => 20
	* The hitbox size for their melee attack has been shrunk to 75% of its original size.
	# Overall, they should be more threatening, but the player can mitigate their threat at the cost of
	  giving other enemies more time to kill you!

* Adjusted the Archer Legionarre enemy:
	* Increased their health: 750 => 1000
	* Increased their projectile speed: 1800 => 3000.
	* Made their projectiles 33% larger; They are now the same size as Ranged Squire shots.

* Adjusted the Vigilant enemy:
	* Increased their health: 1500 => 2200.
	* They no longer fire the moment they spawn (Thanks Travis!), instead waiting for 1 second.
	* The player's melee attacks deal 50% more damage (1050) instead of having their damage set to 3000.

* Adjusted the Ranged Squire enemy:
	* Increased their health: 400 => 600
	* Increase their projectile speed: 1800 => 3000.

* Adjusted the Melee Squire enemy:
	* Increased their health: 600 => 900.
	* They are faster: 500 => 600

	> Bugfixes

* Fixes a bug in which the player's upgrades would cease to have any effect some time after they were chosen.

* Fixed a bug where the Upgrade blueprints were unable to use many blueprint nodes (such as line traces).


=== Update 16 "Night City of Doom!" ===

	> General

* Enemies now have attack sounds.

* Adjusted the Gladiator:
	* They have more health 1500->2000.
	* Bombs deal 50% more damage to them and stun them for 2 seconds.

* Legionnaire Archers have reduced health 900->750.

* Vigilant now take 3000 bonus damage from melee attacks.

* The player's gun is now in the game!


=== Update 15 "Legionnaires of Doom!" ===

	> General

* Added Legionnaire Archers to the enemy pool. They fire projectiles in threes, spawn in pairs, and take 1000 damage
  (enough to kill them in 1 hit) when stunned.

	> Bugfixes

* The spawn pool of enemies as well the pool of enemy "rewards" now properly reset when the player respawns.

 
=== Update 14 "Foe Choices Doom!" ===

# We got accepted into Playtest Planet!

	> General

* Once per round, the player can now choose a Knight enemy type to appear in the current and future waves. Until an enemy
  type is chosen, they show up in the game's wave listings as an "Unchosen Foe".
	* An enemy type must be chosen before the player can start the round, unless all enemy types have been choosen.
	* The available enemies are taken from the Knight Spawn Data Table.
	* The appearance of the "Unchosen Foe" in the game's UI can be set from the UrsadeathGameInstance blueprint.

* Altered the enemy waves to introduce the second round's new enemy type better.


 === Update 13 "Night City Releas of Doom!" ===

	> General

* The player can now restart the game when they die.

* Adjusted the Lazer Knight:
	* Halved the distance they aim ahead of the player.
		# They have a comedic tendency to point their lasers way away from the player, often blocking some 
		  corner that the player hadn't planned on moving into anyway.
	* Halve the laser's warning period before it fires. (1s => 0.5s)
		# So that if that if the player decides to walk through the laser despite being warned of it, it comes
		  online just fast enough to hit them.

* Increased the damage Melee Knights deal (20 => 35).

* Increased the self damage Rockets deal to the player (10 => 20).

* Adjusted Health Pickups:
	* They take a slightly shorter time to respawn (35s => 30s).
	* They heal for slightly more (35 -> 40).

* A sound now plays whenever the player gains a bar of energy.

	> Bugfixes

* Ranged and Lazer enemies no longer freeze in place until something blocks their view of the player.

* The player now properly collides with enemies.


 === Update 13 "Finally Fixed UI of Doom!" ===

	> General

* Added a Game Over screen that appears when the player runs out of health.
	# Currently, the play mode must be exited and reopened to reset the game. There are a few things I need
	  to figure out before I can make the game properly reset itself!

* Added more sounds to the player including:
	* A "hurt" sound
	* A sound that plays when the player tries to use an ability without enough energy.

* Tweaked the size of the Round Screen UI button.

	> Bugfixes
	
* The Round Screen no longer needs to be clicked before the Round Start button can be pressed.

* The screen no longer needs to be clicked to aim after the player leaves the round screen.


 === Update 12 "QoL of Doom!" ===

	> General

* Added a crosshair

* Shockwaves now destroy projectiles.

* Enemies now have particles above their head while stunned.

* Enemies now make a sound when they take damage.

* Ranged Squires have been adjusted:
	* Their projectiles now have a bright gold emissive material.
	* They deal less damage (25 => 15) but have faster projectiles (800 => 1800).

* Reduced the attack cooldown of Laser Knights (5 => 3 seconds).

* Adjusted the player's primary fire.
	* The attack's energy gain has been reduced (5% => 3%)
	* The projectiles now move 50% faster (3000 => 4500).
		# This help make them feel like they have more "Oomf!" to them.

* The energy gain from melee attacks have been reduced (50% => 40%).

	> Bugfixes
		
* Fixed a bug where the InfiniteEnergy setting didn't actually work.

* Fixed a bug where the Laser Knight would continue to fire their laser even when stunned.

* Fixed a bug where the Ranged Squire's projectiles would block player movement but not actually damage them.

* The player start now ALWAYS spawns the player, preventing a confusing crash if something was placed over their spawn
   point.

	~ Known Bugs

* The game must be clicked before the Round Screen's "Begin Round" button may be pressed.

* When the Round Screen's "Begin Round" button is pressed and the Round Screen is exitted, the mouse must be clicked before
  the player can aim with it.

* When a ranged enemy spawns, they don't do anything until the player leaves their line of sight. Sometimes they will also
  freeze if the player is far away.


 === Update 11 "Descriptions of Doom!" ===

	> General

* The Round Screen now displays a description of an enemy type whenever its icon is moused over. (You might have to click
  the screen after opening the Round Screen to get this working)
	* Enemy descriptions can be editted in their "Spawn Data" data table. The description for squires can be editted in
	  the UrsadeathGameInstance class.

	~ Known Bugs

* The game must be clicked before the Round Screen's "Begin Round" button may be pressed.

* When the Round Screen's "Begin Round" button is pressed and the Round Screen is exitted, the mouse must be clicked before
  the player can aim with it.


 === Update 10 "Round Screen of Doom!" ===

	> General

* Added a "Round Screen" that can be open/closed with 'T'.

* Rounds are now started by pressing a "Begin Round" button in the Round Screen. Once a round is complete, the next round
  can be begun in the same manner, assuming a next round exists.

* Added health pickups which spawn at the arena's blue arrows when play is begun. They are used by meleeing them and
  respawn after 35 seconds.

* Added "Spawn Data" for the Lazer enemy. It currently uses a placeholder graphic for its icon.

* Made some adjustments to the Player HUD to make the spawn counters stay centered on different screen sizes.

	~ Known Bugs

* The game must be clicked before the Round Screen's "Begin Round" button may be pressed.

* When the Round Screen's "Begin Round" button is pressed and the Round Screen is exitted, the mouse must be clicked before
  the player can aim with it.


 === Update 9 "Spawn Counts of Doom!" ===

	> General

* Added counters that show how much of a given enemy type is left in a given wave.
	* Information on editting the UI for this can be found in the "Player HUD" section of the project's GitHub Wiki:
	   https://github.com/StacyNComer/Ursadeath/wiki

* You now spawn enemies in by pressing the "P" key. You can still set the Arena to spawn on Begin Play, 
  but the Spawn Indicators will not update to show what's in the wave.
	* You can change what is in the wave and its spawning behavior from the player character blueprint.


 === Update 8 "Testing of Doom!" ===

	> General

* The Test Knight enemy now has its own models and animations
	# It's just an upscaled version of the Melee Squire with x3 health.

* Melee attacks have been tweaked some:
	* They have slightly longer range: 250 -> 300.
	* They give slightly less energy: 66% -> 50%.

* Ranged Squires have a bit less health: 500 -> 400.

	> Bugfixes

* Fixed a bug where enemies would not stop moving when stunned.

* The enemies with the new models now properly collide with the player and their attacks.

* Fixed a bug where the sword of melee squires could be hit by player attacks.

* Fixed a bug where Rocket explosions dealt damage as if it were a direct hit.

* Fixed a bug where Ranged Squire projectiles would go through everything.


 === Update 7 "Particles of Doom!" ===

	> General

* Added VFX for the melee attack, Shockwave, and Rocket Explosion.

* The player character can now be set to have infinite energy.
	* As a reminder, you can also set individual ability components to require 0 energy. Only the Rocket
	  and Shockwave abilities have an energy setting.

* Explosive projectiles now have an "ExplosionDebug" property that prints each actor the explosion detected.
	* Note that explosions should detect all Actors with the Pawn and Player object types, but will
	  only damage actors that are derived from the Enemy or PlayerCharacter classes.

 === Update 6 "Weapons of Doom!" ===

	> General

* Added melee attacks. Melee attacks give the player 66% energy on hit.
	* This does not have a vfx, so for now the collision test is visible.

* Added Shockwaves. Shockwaves deal no damage, but stun all enemies in a wide line for 4 seconds. 
  Shockwave cost 100% energy.
	* This does not have a vfx, so for now the collision test is visible.
	# This probably needs to be nerfed somehow.

* Refactored all of the player's abilities as PlayerAbilityComponents. This groups all the info about each particular
  attack's interaction with the player (energy cost, cooldown, input binding) under their own blueprint component.
	* Currently, PlayerAbilities are not automatically bound to their inputs. If you try and add your onw ability,
	  you'll need to bind the input yourself!

	> Bugfixes

* Fixed a bug where the game would crash if a projectile hit an enemy within a frame of being spawned.


 === Update 5 "HUD of Doom!" ===

* Added the framework for UI. 
	* The players HUD widget should be derived from the "UDPlayerHUDWidget" class. To define what happens when the
	   player's health/energy changes, use the respective "Update Health/Energy" event.
	* The player controller will automatically create and add whatever widget the "Player HUD Widget Class" is set to.
	  You can find the player controller in the player blueprint folder.
	* An example of the HUD Widget is in the UI folder. It should already be connected to the Player Controller.
	* Finally, if you get a weird crash that opens Visual Studio, most likely the Player Controller's 
	  "Player HUD Widget Class" value got set to "None".
	* This info can also be found in the project's wiki on Github's website!

# By the way, the player currently gains energy by shooting enemies with primary fire. You can change how much energy this
  gives the player in the projectile's blueprint. Rockets need 100 energy to be fired.


 === Update 4 "Arena of Doom!" ===

 * The game arena now takes the form of a blueprint.
	* You can make the arena spawn enemies by editing the Current Wave structure and setting the "Spawn On Begin
	  Play" value (under Debug) to true. The current arena in the game should already be set to spawn enemies.
	* The Spawn Wave asks for "Knight" and "Squire" enemies. These are merely tiers of strength for enemies.
	  Any enemy can be spawned as a Knight/Squire as there is no difference between them in script.

 * Added a "Test Knight" enemy type. It is large and has 1500 health (thrice that of the melee squire). It has the 
   same AI as the Melee Squire.


 === Update 3 "Spawning of Doom!" ===

* Enemies now take a moment to "Spawn In" before recieving their AI and becoming tangible. Enemies are give a special
  material to show that they are spawning. The spawning sequence can be skipped by checking "Spawn Instantly".
	* As a result of this change, enemy pawns are not set to be auto-possessed. Turning back on auto-possession
	  will probably make something weird happen, so just use the "Spawn Instantly" variable!
	* The "Dummies" placed around the arena spawn instantly by default.
	* Note that enemy models are given their default material after going through the spawn sequence. "Spawn Instantly"
	  will stop the textures from being swapped. You can also find the mesh asset and change its default material.


 === Update 2 "AI of Doom!" ===

	> General

* Scripted the framework for enemy AI. An example melee enemy that chases the player (but doesn't attack) has been placed in the
  arena map.
	* All enemy AI Controllers are derived from the "UDEnemyController" class, which is made to have child classes made from it
	  using blueprints.
		* This class has an "EnemyBehavior" variable; Whatever Behavior Tree this variable is set to will be ran when the
		  game starts.
		* If the Behavior Tree's Blackboard has a value named "Player", it will be set to be the player's Actor.
		  BB_EnemyBase should already be set up like this, so I recommend you make any new Blackboards a child of this.
		* Enemies themselves have an "Attack" event that you can define behavior for in Blueprints. The enemy AI does
		  not currently call this event.
		* All of this info is on the project's Github under the "Enemy AI" wiki page.


 === Update 1 "Rockets of Doom!" ===

	> General

* The player can now press M2 to fire rockets. They look exactly like primary fire projectiles, but they explode when they hit something.

* Deleted unused blueprints (Pickup and FirstPersonProjectile).

* "UrsadeathCharacter" is now "UDPlayerCharacter" so that the naming scheme matches.

	> Bugfixes

* Fixed an issue where player attacks wouldn't collide with the arena.
